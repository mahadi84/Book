I'm muhammad Mahadi Hasan, 41 years old, completed my MSc in Computer Science and working for a Private Bank for the last 10 years as a Support Engineer(Computer), living in Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
I found that last more than 1.5 Years (1 Jan 2024 to today 24 March 2025) watching 2 hours of Bangladeshi  Political news every day and always thinking, and I am kind of addicted to it and 30 minutes of programming.
I want now is to transfer my complete concentration from watching and thinking about politics to programming completely to become a Support Engineer(Computer) to a Software Engineer. 
How can I do that? suggest to me the real-life steps to achieve my goal.
