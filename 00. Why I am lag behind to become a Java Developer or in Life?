Comparing yourself to others can be tricky â€“ everyone has their own path and pace. 
Here's a breakdown of how to figure out what might be contributing to the difference you see and how to move forward:

1. Honest Self-Reflection
    Time and Effort:
      > Be realistic about the hours you've consistently dedicated to learning Java.
      > Have you been as focused and disciplined as your friends?
      > Were there periods where you took breaks or prioritized other things?
    Learning Strategies:
      > How do you learn best? Are you using effective methods (hands-on projects, courses, etc.)?
      > Are you actively seeking out help and feedback when you're stuck?
    Priorities and Goals:
      > Are you truly passionate about becoming a Java developer?
      > Are there other goals or interests competing for your time and energy?
      > Have you clearly defined your career goals in this field?

2. Analyze Your Friends' Journeys (Without Comparison)
    Learning Paths:
      > How did your friends learn Java? Did they have different resources, mentors, or opportunities?
      > Did they start earlier, perhaps with prior programming experience?
    Circumstances:
      > Have their personal circumstances allowed them to dedicate more time and energy to their careers?
      > Do they have different financial situations or support systems?
    Motivation and Drive:
      > What drives your friends in their careers? Are they more competitive or ambitious in this area?

3. Identify External Factors
    Opportunities:
      > Have your friends had more access to internships, networking events, or job opportunities?
      > Is your network supporting your job search as much as theirs might be?
    Resources:
      > Have you had the same access to quality learning resources, tools, and technologies?
      > Have financial constraints limited your options?

4. Focus on Your Own Path
  -Set Realistic Goals: Define clear, achievable goals for your Java development journey.
  -Create a Plan: Break down your goals into smaller steps and create a timeline for achieving them.
  -Seek Support: Find a mentor, join a community, or connect with other learners for support and motivation.
  -Celebrate Your Progress: Acknowledge your achievements and focus on continuous improvement.

Important Reminders:
Comparison is the Thief of Joy: Comparing yourself to others can lead to negativity and self-doubt. Focus on your own journey and progress.
Everyone's Timeline is Different: There's no "right" time to achieve success. Some people may find success earlier, while others may take a longer, but equally valid, path.
Life is More Than a Career: Your worth is not solely defined by your professional achievements. Cultivate other areas of your life that bring you joy and fulfillment.

It's natural to feel a sense of urgency, but remember that a successful and fulfilling life is a marathon, not a sprint. 
Focus on your own growth, celebrate your accomplishments, and be patient with yourself.
