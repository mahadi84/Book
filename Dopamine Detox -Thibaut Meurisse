Dopamine Addiction: A Modern Scourge (একটি আধুনিক ক্ষতি)

In his book "Dopamine Detox," Thibaut Meurisse delves into the concept of dopamine addiction, 
a modern phenomenon driven by the constant bombardment of stimuli in our digital age. 


What is Dopamine?: A neurotransmitter, The Brain's Reward System
        This reward system is essential for motivation, learning, and survival.   
        It's released when we experience pleasure or anticipate a reward.   
        However, excessive stimulation can lead to a state of dependence, where we crave constant gratification and struggle to focus on tasks that don't provide immediate rewards.   

The Digital Dopamine Loop:
        Digital platforms, especially social media, are designed to trigger dopamine release.   
        Constant notifications, likes, comments, and shares create a cycle of intermittent reinforcement, keeping us hooked.   
        This leads to a heightened sensitivity to rewards, making it difficult to focus on tasks that don't provide instant gratification.   

Consequences of Dopamine Addiction:
        -Decreased Attention Span: Constant distractions erode our ability to focus on important tasks.   
        -Increased Anxiety and Depression: The fear of missing out (FOMO) and social comparison can lead to negative emotions.   
        -Impaired Decision-Making: Addiction to instant gratification can hinder our ability to make rational choices.
        -Sleep Disturbances: Excessive screen time can disrupt sleep patterns, affecting overall health.
