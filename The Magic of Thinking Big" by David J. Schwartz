Here's a breakdown of the main points of "The Magic of Thinking Big" by David J. Schwartz:

1. Build and Maintain Belief in Yourself
 Develop a "Can-Do" Attitude: Believe in your ability to achieve your goals. This mindset fosters confidence and resilience.
 Think Big: Set ambitious goals and visualize success. Don't let self-doubt or limitations hold you back.
 Develop a Positive Mental Attitude: Focus on your strengths and opportunities rather than dwelling on weaknesses and obstacles. 
 Boost Your Self-Confidence: Dress well, maintain good posture, and speak assertively to enhance your self-image.

2. Go the Extra Mile
 Develop a Service-First Attitude: Focus on providing value to others. This builds strong relationships and creates opportunities.
 Be Enthusiastic: Your passion and energy are contagious. Let your enthusiasm inspire others.
 Be a Go-Getter: Take initiative and be proactive in pursuing your goals. Don't wait for opportunities to come to you.
 Develop a "Yes" Habit: Be open to new challenges and experiences. Embrace change and step outside your comfort zone.

3. Develop a Positive Mental Attitude
 Think Positively: Focus on the good and avoid negativity. Negative thoughts can be self-fulfilling.
 Control Your Thoughts: Practice positive self-talk and avoid dwelling on negative emotions.

 Be Persistent: Don't give up easily. Persist through challenges and setbacks.
 Be a Lifelong Learner: Continuously seek new knowledge and skills to improve yourself.
