Core Concept: The book focuses on the idea that how you start your day dramatically affects your levels of success in every area of your life. 
It introduces the Life S.A.V.E.R.S., a 6-step morning routine designed to unlock your potential:


01. Mental Clarity  02. Limiting Beliefs  03. Achieving Goals and Ideal Life
04. Energy and Mood 05. Perspective(দৃষ্টিকোণ), and Personal Growth 06. Thoughts, Progress, Gratitude


What, Why and How?:

SILENCE: আমি আমার মানসিক চাপ কমায়, আমার মানসিক স্বচ্ছতা উন্নত করতে।  (I reduce my stress and improve my mental clarity.) 
Start with just 5 minutes of my day with quiet time for meditation, prayer, reflection, deep breathing, or gratitude. 

AFFIRMATIONS:আমি আমার মনকে পুনরায় প্রোগ্রাম করি, আমার সীমিত বিশ্বাসকে অতিক্রম করতে। (I Reprograme my mind and overcoming my limiting beliefs.)
Create Affirmations that Bridge the Gap(Where am I now, and where do I want to be)
Write, Repeat, and Believe positive statements to me.
  Example: 
  01. I struggle with procrastination, my affirmation might be: "I am disciplined and focused, completing tasks efficiently and effectively."
  02. Personal Growth: "I am constantly learning and growing, expanding my knowledge and skills to reach my full potential to be a SOFTWARE ENGINEER."

VISUALIZATION: আমি আমার লক্ষ্য অর্জন করতে এবং আদর্শ জীবনযাপন করতে। (Achieving my goals and living ideal life.) 
Imagine yourself.
  Elrod suggests incorporating visualization into my morning routine by:
  Creating a vision board: A collage of images and affirmations representing your goals.   
  Visualizing your ideal day: Imagine yourself going through your perfect day, experiencing success and happiness in every aspect.   
  Mental rehearsal: If you have a specific goal, like a presentation or competition, visualize yourself performing it flawlessly.

EXERCISE: আমি আমার শক্তি এবং মেজাজ বৃদ্ধি করতে। (Boosting my energy and mood.)
Engage in physical activity I like, even if it's just for a few minutes.

READING: আমি জ্ঞান অর্জন করি, আমার দৃষ্টিভঙ্গি প্রসারিত করতে  এবং ব্যক্তিগত বৃদ্ধি এবং বিকাশ করতে ।  (Gaining knowledge, expanding my perspective, and personal growth.)
Read something inspiring or educational. Aim for a certain number of pages or chapters each day.

SCRIBING: আমি আমার চিন্তাধারা পরিষ্কার করি, আমার অগ্রগতি ট্র্যাক করতে এবং কৃতজ্ঞতা গড়ে তুলতে । (Clarifying my thoughts, tracking my progress, and cultivating gratitude.)
Write in a journal.

  Real-Life Examples of Scribing:
  Goal Setting and Tracking: Let's say my goal is to write a book. I might use my journal to break down the project into smaller steps, track my daily word count, and brainstorm ideas. Elrod himself used this technique to overcome challenges and achieve success after a near-fatal car accident.
  Overcoming Limiting Beliefs: Imagine I struggle with self-doubt. Scribing can be a tool to challenge those negative thoughts. I could write affirmations like "I am capable," or analyze past successes to build confidence.
  Processing Emotions: If I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed, journaling can provide an outlet. Writing about my feelings helps release tension and gain perspective. Elrod emphasizes that journaling was crucial for his mental and emotional recovery after his accident.
  Learning from Experiences: Reflecting on my day, both the highs and lows, can reveal valuable lessons. I might write about a challenging interaction at work and identify how I could handle similar situations differently in the future.



Start small and gradually increase the time you spend on each practice.
Be Patient and Consistent: Consistency is key. Make it a habit to track your progress regularly.
Be Specific: Don't just write general statements. Be specific about your accomplishments, challenges, and learnings.
Be Creative: Don't limit yourself to traditional methods. Explore different ways to express your progress and make it enjoyable.
Be Honest: Don't be afraid to express your true feelings, both positive and negative. This will help you gain valuable insights into your journey.



  "The most difficult thing is not any specific life event, but rather the 
    01. Ongoing process of self-discipline and 
    02. Personal development." -Hal Elrod
